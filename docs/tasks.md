# IGDB Types Improvement Tasks

This document contains a list of actionable improvement tasks for the IGDB Types project. Each task is designed to
enhance the codebase, improve developer experience, or add new features.

## Code Organization and Architecture

- [X] Implement a consistent naming convention for all files and types
- [X] Refactor type definitions to use more specific primitive types where applicable
- [X] Add index files for each subdirectory to improve import experience
- [ ] Consider organizing types into logical groups/subdirectories based on IGDB API endpoints
- [ ] Implement utility types for common patterns (e.g., Expandable<T> for ID | Object pattern)
- [ ] Add runtime type validation using a library like zod or io-ts
- [ ] Review and update deprecated fields, considering removal or replacement
- [X] Implement versioning strategy for API changes

## Documentation

- [X] Create comprehensive API documentation using TypeDoc
- [X] Add an examples directory with usage examples for common scenarios
- [X] Improve JSDoc comments with more detailed descriptions and examples
- [X] Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file with guidelines for contributors
- [X] Add a CHANGELOG.md file to track version changes
- [X] Enhance README.md with more detailed usage examples and API overview
- [X] Document the relationship between types and IGDB API endpoints
- [X] Create visual diagrams of type relationships

## Testing

- [ ] Implement unit tests for type definitions using a framework like Jest
- [ ] Add integration tests with sample API responses
- [ ] Set up continuous integration with GitHub Actions
- [ ] Add test coverage reporting
- [ ] Implement snapshot testing for type definitions
- [ ] Create test utilities for common testing patterns
- [ ] Add tests for edge cases and unusual API responses

## Build Process

- [ ] Update TypeScript configuration for better type safety
- [ ] Implement a bundling solution (like Rollup) for different module formats
- [ ] Add source maps for better debugging
- [ ] Optimize package size by excluding unnecessary files
- [ ] Set up automated release process
- [ ] Implement semantic versioning enforcement
- [ ] Add build performance metrics

## Developer Experience

- [ ] Add ESLint for code quality enforcement
- [ ] Implement Prettier for consistent code formatting
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks with husky and lint-staged
- [ ] Create VS Code workspace settings for consistent developer experience
- [ ] Add npm scripts for common development tasks
- [ ] Implement automated dependency updates with Dependabot
- [ ] Create issue and pull request templates
- [ ] Add GitHub project boards for task management

## Type Enhancements

- [ ] Review all types for accuracy against latest IGDB API
- [ ] Add more specific types for string enums and constants
- [ ] Implement branded types for IDs to prevent mixing different entity IDs
- [ ] Add utility types for common API operations (filtering, expansion, etc.)
- [ ] Improve date handling with more specific types
- [ ] Add validation for required fields in API responses
- [ ] Implement generic types for pagination and common API patterns

## Performance and Optimization

- [ ] Analyze and reduce bundle size
- [ ] Implement tree-shaking friendly exports
- [ ] Optimize type definitions for faster type checking
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Implement lazy loading patterns for large type definitions
- [ ] Optimize circular dependencies between types

## Community and Collaboration

- [ ] Set up community discussion channels
- [ ] Create a roadmap for future development
- [ ] Implement a code of conduct
- [ ] Add recognition for contributors
- [ ] Set up a documentation website
- [ ] Create tutorials and blog posts about using the library
- [ ] Engage with IGDB community for feedback
